# CINEPHILE

This project was created to teach students how to use Vue.js. To create the project, we used the "Vite" project development and build server and the "Vue 3" framework. During my studies I taught:
+ downloading custom fonts,
+ using the SCSS preprocessor,
+ naming classes according to the BEM methodology,
+ creating animation using the "Transition" component,
+ creating a slider using the "Swiper" library,
+ routing using the "Vue Router" module,
+ creating a local storage using the "Pinia" module,
+ Firebase is used to register users and store information about them.
